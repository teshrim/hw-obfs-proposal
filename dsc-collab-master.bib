We demonstrate that if two probability distributions D and E of
sufficiently small min-entropy have statistical difference $\backslash$psilon, then
the direct-product distributions D^l and E^l have statistical difference
at least roughly $\backslash$psilon\sqrt{l}, provided that l is sufficiently small,
smaller than roughly $\backslash$psilon^{-4/3}.  Previously known bounds did not
work for few repetitions l, requiring l>$\backslash$psilon^{-2}.},
